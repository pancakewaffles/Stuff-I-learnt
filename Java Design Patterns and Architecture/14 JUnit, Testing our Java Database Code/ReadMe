This is a tutorial on JUnit - How to use JUnit
The project includes the most updated code (i.e. after Lecture 13 DAO Factories) after the implementation
of DAO Factories. 
It added codes for PersonDAO under the Model package, such as functions for updatePerson, deletePerson and so on.
It's a good checkpoint!
Just for Review: What we have done till now
We started off with a simple Model View Controller pattern, which provided a macro-overview for our program.
Then we dived into the Observer Pattern, a miro-overview for relationships between the Model, View and Controller.
We were able to create listeners (as interfaces) to connect different parts of the MVC.
Then we dived into the Singleton Pattern which allowed us to create a global variable - a universal Database of sorts.
Then we moved to Data Access Objects and Beans.
Beans are information classes, i.e. transfer objects that are added/removed to a Database.
We saw how to interact with them, using the Data Access Object classes, which are required for each Bean because DAOs are the ones who REALLY interact with the database.
Finally we create a DAO Factory to automate the process of create DAOs. It's just a class that returns new PersonDAO() and returns new LogDAO().


So to use JUnit, we create another folder called JUnittests, and in it create a JUnit Test Case. 
It is basically just a java class with some particular methods to test a class.
