/*
 * Front-End vs Back-End
 * Golden rules:
 * Front-End always imports Back-End
 * Back-End NEVER imports Front-End
 * Front-End may have bugs etc but Back-End must always work
 * 
 * Model-View-Controller(MVC) Theory
 * Model = Data (holding some data, interface with some data, data model etc)
 * View = Graphic User Interface. Something which interacts with the viewer. It is what the viewer sees. Different views with the same model. Representing data differently.
 * Controller = "Business Logic". Logic of the application. Stuff that does not deal with the data or the viewer.
 * 
 * Views are front-end, models are back-end
 * 
 * View <--- (requests) data from --- Model 
 * View <--- "listens" to --- Model 
 * 
 * Model <--- receives instructions from / "listens" to --- Controller
 * View <--- receives instructions from / "listens" to  --- Controller
 * 
 * Controller detects when things happen to the view.
 * 
 * MVC can be used for complex applications such as games.
