# Asset Roundup

As usual, let's set up and test the assets we'll need for this level. The bullet/plazma burst and powerup are straightforward. The explosion, needs to be set up just like GigaGal's walking left and right animations.

Start with the TODOs in `Constants.java`, then add the inner classes in `Assets.java`, and finally do some test drawing in `Level.java`.
