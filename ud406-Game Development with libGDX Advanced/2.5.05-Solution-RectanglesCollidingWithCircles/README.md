# Rectangle/Circle Collision

Getting to solve little math and geometry puzzles is one of my favorite parts of game development. In this case, we have GigaGal, whose hitbox we can roughly discribe as a rectangle. Then we have the enemies, the dangerous part of which is a circle. How can you tell when a rectangle is overlapping with circle?

In this project we have a demo with a collection of stationary rectangles, and moving circles. When the circles are overlapping with no rectangles, they're green. When they are overlapping, they should turn red. It's your job to complete the function that performs that test.

Check out the TODOs to find the function you'll need to tackle!
