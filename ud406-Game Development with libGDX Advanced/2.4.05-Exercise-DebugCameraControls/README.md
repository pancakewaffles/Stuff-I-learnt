# Add Debug Camera Controls

So now we can build levels that are as large as we want, but it's a bit of a pain that if we want to check out the bits of the level that are far away from GigaGal's spawn point, we need to actually walk GigaGal over there.

Let's fix that by adding some debug camera controls to allow the camera to move independently of GigaGal.

Check out the TODOs in the course code to add debug camera controls!
