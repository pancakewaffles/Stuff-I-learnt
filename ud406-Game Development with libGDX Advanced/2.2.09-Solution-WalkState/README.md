# Walk State

In this exercise, we'll add an enum to keep track of whether or not GigaGal is walking, and we'll load up one of the walking sprites to display when she's walking on the ground.
 
Check out the TODOs in `Constants.java`, `Assets.java`, and `GigaGal.java`. Also note that you'll want to define the `WalkState` enum before doing anything else in `GigaGal.java`.
