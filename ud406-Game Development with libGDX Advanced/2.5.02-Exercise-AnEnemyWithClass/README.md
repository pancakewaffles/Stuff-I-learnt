# An Enemy With Class 


Let's start fleshing out, errrr, building out our robots. When we're done, we'll have an enemy sitting on a platform. Though they're not moving or colliding with anything yet.


Our Enemy class needs a render method to draw itself, and will need to hold onto a platform and a position. We'll also need a collection in our Level to hold onto the enemies. Finally, we need to add some enemies to our debug level.

Check out the TODOs to get started!
