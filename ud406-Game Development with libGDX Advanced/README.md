# 2D Game Development with LibGDX

This repository contains all the code for the free Udacity class [ud406: How to Make a Platformer Using LibGDX](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-make-a-platformer-using-libgdx--ud406). These demos and exercises were designed to accompany the course, but are a fine learning resource in their own right.

You can download this code using the gray "Download ZIP" button.

Instructions for importing and running these projects can be found in the [2.1.01-Demo-ImportAndRunAProject](https://github.com/udacity/ud406/tree/master/2.1.01-Demo-ImportAndRunAProject) folder.

Issues and pull requests welcome!

## The exercises for 2.8 are under development. Stay tuned!
