# Remove the Floor

One of the ubiquitous mechanics of platformers is the bottomless pit: if the character falls off the platforms, they fall to their doom. Right now though, we've got a friendly floor at y = 0, extending off to positive and negative infinity. Let's remove that.

Remove the floor from GigaGal's update() method to add some consequences for missing a jumpz. Oh, and while you're at it, you should probably make sure that when the level starts, GigaGal is positioned to land on a platform.
