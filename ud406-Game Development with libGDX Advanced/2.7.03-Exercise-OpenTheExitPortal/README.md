# Open the Exit Portal

Before we can load up the location of the exit portal from the level, we should probably add an exit portal entity to our level! This one will hopefully be pretty familiar. It's similar to GigaGal, in that there can only be one in the level, but we'll also need to create an animation, just like the explosion.
  
For this exercise we've gone back to using the debug level, instead of loading the level file. So, first, there's a couple constants to define, then you'll need to whip up an assets class. Next define the class for the entity itself, and finally, add it to the level!

Best of luck with the TODOs, and check out the solution file if you run into trouble!
