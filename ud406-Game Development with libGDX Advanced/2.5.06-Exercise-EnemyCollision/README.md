# Enemy Collision

Let's set up collision detection to check when GigaGal runs into an enemy robot. To keep matters simple, we'll simply define rectangles around GigaGal and around each of the enemies, and check for overlaps.

Start off in `Constants.java`, making sure we've got constants for the height and width of GigaGal, as well as the collision radius of the enemy. Check out the rest of the TODOs to finish up collision detection!
