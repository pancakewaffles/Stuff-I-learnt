# Jump Sprites!

Here's a bit of an easier exercise after the jumping marathon. Right now GigaGal doesn't look like she's jumping, we just keep displaying the standing sprites. Let's fix that by adding the jumping-left and jumping-right sprites to our asset loading system, and then in GigaGal's render callback, let's pick the right sprite to display based on both her facing direction and jumpState!

Check out the TODOs in `Constants.java`, `Assets.java`, and `GigaGal.java`.
